# To Do List

### Simple To Do List using Ruby On Rails
This is a simple to do list made using Ruby on Rails. There are 4 models: Team, User, Task, List. A Team has multiple users. As a user, you can create many tasks. You can also assign these tasks to other people on your team. Every task is also assigned to a category, which is unique for your team. In the task show page, you can click on "Complete Task", which will change the value of your task to "done". When all the tasks in a list are completed, the list's value is changed to "completed" from "incomplete". User has the ability to delete teams, tasks, and lists, as well as edit all of them too.

### To Run
Run `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, then `rails s` in your terminal to open up the server!
